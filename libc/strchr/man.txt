NAME
	strchr, strrchr – locate character in string

LIBRARY
	Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
	#include <string.h>
	char	*strchr(const char *s, int c);
	char	*strrchr(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
	The strchr() function locates the first occurrence of [c] (converted to a char) in the string pointed to by [s].
	The terminating NULL character is considered to be part of the string;
		therefore if [c] is '\0', the functions locate the terminating '\0'.

	The strrchr() function is identical to strchr(), except it locates the last occurrence of [c].

RETURN VALUES
	The functions return a pointer to the located character, or NULL if the character does not appear in the string.
