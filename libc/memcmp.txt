NAME
	memcmp – compare byte string

LIBRARY
	Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
	#include <string.h>
	int	memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
	The function compares byte string [s1] against byte string [s2].
	Both strings are assumed to be [n] bytes long.

RETURN VALUES
	The function returns zero if the two strings are identical, otherwize returns the difference between the first two differing bytes.
	(treated as unsigned char values, so that '\200' is greater than '\0', for example)
	Zero-length strings are always identical.
	This behivior is not required by C and portable code should only depend on the sign of the returned value.
