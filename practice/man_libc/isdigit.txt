NAME
	isdigit, isnumberi – decimal-digit character test

LIBRARY
	Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
	#include <ctype.h>
	int	isdigit(int c);
	int	isnumber(int c);

DESCRIPTION
	The isdigit() function tests for a decimal digit character.
	Regardless of locale, this includes the following characters only:

		"0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"

	The value of the argument must be representable as an unsigned character or the value of EOF.

RETURN VALUES
	The function returns zero if the character tests false and return non-zero if the character tests true.

COMPATIBILITY
	The 4.4BSD extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the unsigned character type in locales with large character sets is considered
	obsolete and may not be supported in future releases.
	The iswdigit() function should be used instead.

	ctype(3), isalnum_l(3), iswdigit(3), multibyte(3), ascii(7)
