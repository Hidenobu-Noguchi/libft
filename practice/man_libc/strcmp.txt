NAME
	strcmp, strncmp – compare strings

LIBRARY
	Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
	#include <string.h>
	int	strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
	int	strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
	The functions lexicographically compare the null-terminated strings [s1] and [s2].

	The strncmp() function compares not more than [n] characters.
	Because strncmp() is designed for comparing strings rather than binary data, characters that appear after a '\0' character are not compared.

RETURN VALUES
	The functions return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
	according as the string [s1] is greater than, equal to, or less than the string [s2].
	The comparison is done using unsigned character, so that '\200' is greater than '\0'.
